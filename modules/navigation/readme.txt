Explanation of Code
pathfinding.py:

Pathfinding Class: Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in the grid.
Heuristic Function: Uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic to guide the pathfinding.
Neighbor Validation: Ensures that neighbors are within bounds and not obstacles (e.g., water or lava in Minecraft).
Path Reconstruction: Reconstructs the path from the start to the goal using the came_from dictionary.
waypoint_planner.py:

WaypointPlanner Class: Plans paths that go through a series of waypoints for long-distance navigation.
Plan Waypoints: Connects paths from one waypoint to the next, forming a comprehensive route.
Add Waypoint: Allows dynamic addition of waypoints that the AI can use during exploration.
__init__.py:

Exports the Pathfinding and WaypointPlanner classes so they can be imported and used in other modules.

Future Enhancements
Dynamic Path Adjustment: Implement real-time adjustments to the path if obstacles change (e.g., if a mob moves into the path).
Integration with Combat: Coordinate with the combat module to avoid paths with aggressive mobs or to plan routes that allow for strategic combat positioning.
Resource-Efficient Pathfinding: Add features to optimize for paths that minimize resource usage (e.g., avoiding climbing steep terrains to conserve food).
