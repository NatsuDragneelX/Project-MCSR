Includes an attack_pattern method to specify the type of attack each mob uses.
combat_strategy.py:

Contains a CombatStrategy class that determines the best combat action based on the current situation.
choose_attack: Selects the optimal weapon and attack method based on the type of mob being engaged.
defensive_action: Chooses defensive moves, such as blocking or retreating, based on the AI’s health.
adapt_strategy: Adjusts the overall combat approach based on mob distance and the AI’s current health.
