# MinecraftSpeedrunAI

An AI project that uses reinforcement learning to speedrun Minecraft, aiming to outperform human players.

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI agent capable of completing a Minecraft speedrun as efficiently as possible by navigating, gathering resources, crafting items, and battling mobs.

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Project documentation.
- `data/`: Data files from external sources like ChunkBase and Minecraft Wiki.
- `src/`: Source code including modules for navigation, combat, crafting, and reinforcement learning.
- `models/`: Contains trained models, checkpoints, and logs.
- `tests/`: Test cases for unit, integration, and full-sequence tests.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data processing, benchmarking, and environment setup.
