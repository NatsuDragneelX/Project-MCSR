# Mineflayer Speedrun Bot

This project leverages the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) library to create a Minecraft bot capable of simulating a simplified speedrun. The bot performs tasks such as gathering resources, crafting tools, and mining, serving as a foundation for a fully automated Minecraft speedrun bot.

## Features
- **Resource Gathering**: Collects wood, stone, and iron to craft tools.
- **Crafting System**: Crafts essential tools, armor, and weapons.
- **Portal Creation**: Builds a Nether portal using buckets and lava pools.
- **Nether Navigation**: Collects blaze rods and ender pearls to prepare for the End.
- **Stronghold Location**: Finds and navigates the stronghold using Eyes of Ender.
- **Ender Dragon Battle**: Destroys end crystals and fights the Ender Dragon to complete the speedrun.

## Prerequisites
- **Minecraft Java Edition Vr.1.20.4**: Required to connect to the bot's server.
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system to run the bot.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine or download the files directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/mineflayer-speedrun-bot.git
cd mineflayer-speedrun-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
From the project directory, install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install mineflayer
npm install mineflayer-pathfinder
```

### 3. Configure the Bot
Open `bot.js` and update the configuration with your Minecraft server settings:

- **username**: The bot’s display name (e.g., `"SpeedRunnerBot"`).
- **host**: Use `localhost` if the server is running locally, or enter your server's IP address.
- **port**: The server port, default is `25565`.

Example configuration in `Aibot.js`:
```javascript
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
    username: "SpeedRunnerBot",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 25565,
});
```

### 4. Start Your Minecraft Server
Ensure that your Minecraft server is online and matches the IP and port specified in `Aibot.js`. The bot will attempt to connect to this server on startup.

### 5. Run the Bot
In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and start the bot using:

```bash
node Aibot.js
```

The bot will connect to the specified Minecraft server and begin executing its tasks.

### Commands
You can control the bot within Minecraft chat using the following commands:
- **`start`**: Starts the bot's speedrun tasks, including gathering wood, crafting tools, and more.
- **`stop`**: Stops the bot's actions and disconnects it from the server.

### Example Workflow
Once started, the bot will:
1. Gather wood from nearby trees.
2. Craft basic wooden tools.
3. Search for and mine stone, then craft stone tools.
4. Locate and mine iron, smelting it if a furnace is available.

The bot provides real-time feedback in Minecraft chat as it progresses through each task.

## Advanced Usage
This bot serves as a foundation for a Minecraft speedrun bot, focusing on early game tasks. To expand its functionality, consider adding features such as:
- Combat handling for mobs.
- Navigating the Nether and End.
- Locating and activating the End Portal.
  
These additions would require more advanced programming and game mechanics.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Refused**: Double-check the Minecraft server IP and port in `Aibot.js` to ensure they match the server settings.
- **Version Mismatch**: `mineflayer` may not support all Minecraft versions. Check the Mineflayer documentation to ensure compatibility.
- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.

### Changes and Improvements
1. **Clear Dependency Installation**: Streamlined to a single command with a note on required packages.
2. **Configuration Instructions**: Updated to clarify the usage of `username`, `host`, and `port`.
3. **Commands Section**: Provided more detail on what each command does within Minecraft.
4. **Example Workflow**: Organized into a step-by-step list, making it easier to understand the bot's actions.
5. **Advanced Usage**: Suggested enhancements to expand the bot’s functionality.
6. **Troubleshooting**: Improved readability with specific error resolutions.

This should make the setup process and bot usage clearer for users. Let me know if there are specific features or further adjustments you'd like to include!
